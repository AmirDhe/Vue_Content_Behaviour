# Project Overview

This project is a single-page application demonstrating the integration of Vue.js with a responsive web design. The application showcases a collection of topics, each with a title, description, and image, navigable through an interactive interface.

## Requirements Checklist

- [x] **Use of Vue CDN**: The Vue Framework library is connected via Vue CDN.
- [x] **Vue App Object Creation**: A Vue app object with required properties is created according to the code examples.
- [x] **HTML Element Targeting for Vue Rendering**: The Vue properties and the contents of the JS file in the `data` folder are rendered inside a specified HTML element.
